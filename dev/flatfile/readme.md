# Flat File CMSs

|Name|Templating|Pros|Cons|
|----|----------|----|----|
|Kirby|PHP (Twig with plugin)|Easy to use, surpisingly powerful, has admin panel|Price $20 personal, $100 commercial|
|Stacey|Twig|Easy to use|Not easy to use PHP inside the system, abandoned?|
|Yellow|PHP|Easy to use, has admin panel|Docs aren't extensive enough?|
|Grav|Twig|Easy to use|Must learn how to make plugin to use PHP|

My pick would be Kirby (at this date, Jan 2017) even with the price. Great docs, active community and easy to use.
