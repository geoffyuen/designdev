| Name   | Templating           | Admin       | Pros           | Cons                                              |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Kirby  | PHP (Twig w/ plugin) | Yes         | Easy, powerful | Price $20 personal, $100 commercial               |
| Stacey | Twig                 | Easy to use | No             | Not easy to use PHP inside the system, abandoned? |
| Yellow | PHP                  | Yes         | Easy           | Docs aren't extensive enough?                     |
| Grav   | Twig                 | Yes         | Easy           | Must learn how to make plugin to use PHP          |


My pick would be Kirby (at this date, Jan 2017) even with the price. Great docs, active community and easy to use.
