# Flat File CMSs

Notes on flat file CMSs (not just blogs).

| Name   | Templating           | Admin | Pros                    | Cons                                              |
|--------|----------------------|-------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Kirby  | PHP (Twig w/ plugin) | Yes   | Easy, powerful          | Price $20 personal, $100 commercial               |
| Stacey | Twig                 | No    | Easy                    | Not easy to use PHP inside the system, abandoned? |
| Yellow | PHP                  | Yes   | Easy, static gen option | Better Docs?                                      |
| Grav   | Twig                 | Yes   | Easy                    | Must learn how to make plugin to use PHP          |

My pick would be Kirby (at this date, Jan 2017) even with the price. Great docs, powerful, active community and easy to use. Yellow would be a close second because it's free and also quite powerful. The panel is just a simple textarea though. Yellow's static option might even work on Gitlab. Neither are as powerful as WordPress - but could any databaseless CMS?
